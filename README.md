# OpenClassrooms ‚Äì Project 7 Les petits plats

## üìå Description

Source code of **Project 7 ‚Äì Les petits plats**: _Develop a search algorithm with JavaScript_, completed as part of the **OpenClassrooms JavaScript React Developer path**.

This project simulates the development of a **recipe search platform**, 
where the main challenge is to design and implement an **efficient search 
engine** in **vanilla JavaScript**, by designing a scalable search engine where performance and responsiveness directly impact user experience.

The work involved:
- Building a responsive **user interface** with **Bootstrap**, focusing on usability and clarity of recipe search.
- Implementing **two different search algorithms** capable of filtering large JSON datasets.
- Benchmarking and comparing algorithm performance using tools like **Jsben.ch**, to determine the most efficient solution.
- Applying **Green Code principles**, ensuring that the chosen solution is not only performant but also mindful of environmental impact.

This project provided a strong introduction to **algorithm analysis and optimization**, essential skills for handling large datasets in real-world applications.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Educational project**: This repository was created for learning purposes during my training. It is **not intended for production use**.

## üèó Project structure

### Files

- `index.html` ‚Üí Application entry point (home page)
- `assets/` ‚Üí fonts, icons, pictures and data
- `scripts/` ‚Üí JavaScript files

### Script structure

- `scripts/main.js`: application's entry point calling the `Controller`
- `scripts/Controller.js`: contains all the logic of the application and calls View and Model scripts to handle the user interaction
- `scripts/Model.js`: handles the data containing all the necessary methods to dynamically fetch information through filters and sort criteria
- `scripts/Vue.js`: handles the View of the application
- `scripts/components/`: reusable scripts for a complex UI component
- `scripts/services/`: utility functions used in the application

### Search algorithms

Two types of search algorithms were developed:

- `forEach()` loop implementation (manual iteration over the dataset)
- `filter()` implementation (using JavaScript‚Äôs built-in array method)

Both algorithms were benchmarked using [Jsben.ch](https://jsben.ch/).  

‚û°Ô∏è Results showed only **minor performance differences**, meaning that both approaches scale similarly for this dataset size. The choice of algorithm therefore focused more on **code readability and maintainability** rather than raw execution speed.
